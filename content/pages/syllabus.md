Though exploring different types of evidenence and a variety of readings, the course will cover what has happened int he field of mideval studies, and where it's going.

Policy on Plagiarism
--------------------

Plagiarism—the use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement—is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature and History Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted and in all oral presentations. This includes images or texts in other media as well as materials collected online. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available in the [Writing and Communication Center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/), and [the MIT Website on Plagiarism](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/what-plagiarism).

Policy on Late Submission of Papers
-----------------------------------

Unexcused late submissions will incur a penalty of one partial grade step (e.g., from A to B+) for each day late. Only serious and documented circumstances will be accepted as excuses (e.g. serious matters of health or other personal emergencies).

Policy on Laptop Computers in Class
-----------------------------------

You are welcome to use laptop computers in class to take notes or consult assigned readings on the course site. However, using computers to surf the web, write emails, update your Facebook page, etc. during class time will not be tolerated.
